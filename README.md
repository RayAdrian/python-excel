## Installing Python

Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

To check if Python is correctly installed:
Open the **Command Prompt** in Windows and enter `python --version`

You should be able to see the correct version of Python -> Something like Python 3.x.x

## Installing the needed modules
While in the **Command Prompt**, navigate to wherever you have this downloaded.

Once you're in the folder, enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This will install the dependencies you'll need.
